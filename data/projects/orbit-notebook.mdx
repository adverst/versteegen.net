## Why it exists

I needed a minimal place to keep experiments, links, and learnings without turning it into a full blog.
Orbit Notebook keeps entries small, searchable, and tied to real work.

## What is working

- Single-command publishing
- Fast, clean markdown editing
- A timeline view for quick review

## Next steps

I want to add richer filters for experiments and surface active work automatically.
