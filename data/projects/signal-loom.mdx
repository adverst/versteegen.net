## Concept

Signal Loom takes project notes, code changes, and task metadata and turns them into a simple weekly
brief. It focuses on showing momentum rather than raw activity.

## Current focus

- Summaries per project
- Highlighting what actually shipped
- Visual density controls

## Open questions

How much automation is too much? I am testing thresholds that keep the output human.
