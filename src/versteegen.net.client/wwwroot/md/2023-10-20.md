## Hello World

I've had this URL just for email for ages, decided I would actually put something here. I wanted something where I could post random whatever, experiment and tinker a little. So that's what this is. 
\
I didn't want to have to mess around with any complex site setup or config, so this is pretty straightforward - It's a Blazor WASM site, the internal pages are just markdown. Currently pages have to be manually added on page load, maybe I'll make that automatic at some point.

Markdown edit/display seems to work...

```C#
class  Blah
{
  public  string  SomeBlah { get; set; }
  public  string  MoreBlah { get; set; }
}
```

and it looks like quoting works -

The only other interesting thing currently here is a Godot test - Just experimenting. It's pretty easy to get it integrated, but I'd like to experiment with more interactivity between Blazor and Godot.
